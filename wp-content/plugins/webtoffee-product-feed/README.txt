**Hear It From Our Users**

> **kupiter (@kupiter)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
> This is another great plug-in from Webtoffee. “Server cron” is a unique feature to solve issues of running refresh for big websites with multi-currency feeds in designated time, which is very important to us. I am happy to suggest features such as feed duplication (for easier new feed creation), and keep attributes (fields) during feed modification. The support team is fantastic to provide the feature in days.
